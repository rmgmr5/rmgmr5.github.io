Hey everyone. I'm currently a sophomore at Mizzou, and am starting my first semester as a Digital Storytelling major. I love music, as well as any form of audio for that matter. In my free time, I like to record and track artists at the KCOU recording studio, and produce original music. I'm hoping to implement some of these skills throughout this course, and learn new skills that I can implement into my hobbies and future careers.

I'm mostly excited for the web design and publishing side of this class, as that is an element of the digital world that I have no experience with. This is my first online class, so I also look forward to all the virtual discussions we'll be having throughout this semester.
