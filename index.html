  <p>For the first imaging assignment, we were tasked to create unique <a href="https://rmgmr5.github.io/Digital%20Imaging%20Project%20(Banner).jpg">banner</a> and <a href="https://rmgmr5.github.io/icon.png">icon</a> images, with an overall theme of positive parenting. In order to create said images, I used Adobe Photoshop to crop and collage various stock photos. The process was not too difficult as it was mainly composed of the fundamental techniques of digital imaging. Finding my way around the software turned out to be very intuitive, which ultimately helped me to create the finished products with ease.
The <a href="https://rmgmr5.github.io/Part%20Two%20Final%20Image.jpg">second imaging assignmnet</a> was a bit more challenging. For this one, we had to seamlessly integrate one photo into another; and although the underlying idea was somewhat similar to the first assignment, the execution was much different. I decided to take two original photos that I had taken on my phone. The first was a photo of a valley I took in Colorado, and the second was a photo of myself in a St. Louis book store. From here, I attempted to place myself into the Coloradan valley. I made sure to cut myself out with great detail, so as to preserve the illusion I wanted to create. After pasting myself into the new photo, I tweaked the filters and color grading to achieve the seamless look.<p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Audio</b></h1>

    <p>The <a href="https://rmgmr5.github.io/Audio%20Assignmnet%20Final.mp3">audio assignmnet</a> was very broad, in the sense of the amount of freedom were given. For my project, I knew I wanted to make the focus something music-related. I started out by looking through the songs on my hard drive, and when found one worth talking about, I decided to go with it. The song I chose had an odd time signature, which gave me something of substance and purpose to talk about. I recorded my vocals with the microphone I own: the Shure SM57. After recording my narration, I dropped the audio clip into my Ableton, my digital audio workstation, and edited it to go along with the song. This assignment was pretty easy for me to complete since I already had quite a bit of audio production knowledge and experience at the time.

  <!-- Video -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="video" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Video</b></h1>

    <p>For the <a href="https://rmgmr5.github.io/Digital%20Video%20Project%20Final%20[Ryan%20Groom].mp4">video assignmnet</a>, we were given a similar amount of freedom as we were in the audio portion. The project had to be a minute long video, comprised of different video clips, transitions, and audio elements. For my project, I decided to shoot videos of the street that I live on. I ended up with a total of around seven unique shots, which I compiled into a minute long sequence. From here, I used different transitions for the first few clips, so as to gain more experience and comfortability with video effects. The final pieces of the video I added were the audio elements. Throughout the entire video, I included a musical soundtrack, and throughout the first half, a simple narration.
I used my phone to shoot all of the video, and I used iMovie to create the finished product. Much like the other forms of software I’ve used for all these projects, iMovie was simple and intuitive to use. At times, however, I felt as though it was oversimplified, and thus lacking in the ability for the user to get more detailed with the editing power.</p>
